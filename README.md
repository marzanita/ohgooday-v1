# oh gooday

Oh gooday is an SMS reminder web application to help users remember when they need to water their plants. I developed this application in Spring 2019 for my Rapid Application Web Developent class. Currently, users can login with a supplied username and password and create custom reminders that specify when to wate their plants. Users receive one text message each time they create a reminder and then receive the next text message based on the number of days they selected. It is a work in progress. Among the features that I will be adding next are: (a) a registration page for new users, (b) the ability to edit reminders, and (c) a plant database with plant care information.
